<pre class='rust struct'>pub struct WlSurface {
    // some fields omitted
}</pre><div class='docblock'><p>an onscreen surface</p>

<p>A surface is a rectangular area that is displayed on the screen.
It has a location, size and pixel contents.</p>

<p>The size of a surface (and relative positions on it) is described
in surface local coordinates, which may differ from the buffer
local coordinates of the pixel content, in case a buffer_transform
or a buffer_scale is used.</p>

<p>A surface without a &quot;role&quot; is fairly useless, a compositor does
not know where, when or how to present it. The role is the
purpose of a wl_surface. Examples of roles are a cursor for a
pointer (as set by wl_pointer.set_cursor), a drag icon
(wl_data_device.start_drag), a sub-surface
(wl_subcompositor.get_subsurface), and a window as defined by a
shell protocol (e.g. wl_shell.get_shell_surface).</p>

<p>A surface can have only one role at a time. Initially a
wl_surface does not have a role. Once a wl_surface is given a
role, it is set permanently for the whole lifetime of the
wl_surface object. Giving the current role again is allowed,
unless explicitly forbidden by the relevant interface
specification.</p>

<p>Surface roles are given by requests in other interfaces such as
wl_pointer.set_cursor. The request should explicitly mention
that this request gives a role to a wl_surface. Often, this
request also creates a new protocol object that represents the
role and adds additional functionality to wl_surface. When a
client wants to destroy a wl_surface, they must destroy this &#39;role
object&#39; before the wl_surface.</p>

<p>Destroying the role object does not remove the role from the
wl_surface, but it may stop the wl_surface from &quot;playing the role&quot;.
For instance, if a wl_subsurface object is destroyed, the wl_surface
it was created for will be unmapped and forget its position and
z-order. It is allowed to create a wl_subsurface for the same
wl_surface again, but it is not allowed to use the wl_surface as
a cursor (cursor is a different role than sub-surface, and role
switching is not allowed).</p>

<div class='docblock'><p>set the surface contents</p>

<p>Set a buffer as the content of this surface.</p>

<p>The new size of the surface is calculated based on the buffer
size transformed by the inverse buffer_transform and the
inverse buffer_scale. This means that the supplied buffer
must be an integer multiple of the buffer_scale.</p>

<p>The x and y arguments specify the location of the new pending
buffer&#39;s upper left corner, relative to the current buffer&#39;s upper
left corner, in surface local coordinates. In other words, the
x and y, combined with the new surface size define in which
directions the surface&#39;s size changes.</p>

<p>Surface contents are double-buffered state, see wl_surface.commit.</p>

<p>The initial surface contents are void; there is no content.
wl_surface.attach assigns the given wl_buffer as the pending
wl_buffer. wl_surface.commit makes the pending wl_buffer the new
surface contents, and the size of the surface becomes the size
calculated from the wl_buffer, as described above. After commit,
there is no pending buffer until the next attach.</p>

<p>Committing a pending wl_buffer allows the compositor to read the
pixels in the wl_buffer. The compositor may access the pixels at
any time after the wl_surface.commit request. When the compositor
will not access the pixels anymore, it will send the
wl_buffer.release event. Only after receiving wl_buffer.release,
the client may re-use the wl_buffer. A wl_buffer that has been
attached and then replaced by another attach instead of committed
will not receive a release event, and is not used by the
compositor.</p>

<p>Destroying the wl_buffer after wl_buffer.release does not change
the surface contents. However, if the client destroys the
wl_buffer before receiving the wl_buffer.release event, the surface
contents become undefined immediately.</p>

<p>If wl_surface.attach is sent with a NULL wl_buffer, the
following wl_surface.commit will remove the surface content.</p>

<div class='docblock'><p>mark part of the surface damaged</p>

<p>This request is used to describe the regions where the pending
buffer is different from the current surface contents, and where
the surface therefore needs to be repainted. The pending buffer
must be set by wl_surface.attach before sending damage. The
compositor ignores the parts of the damage that fall outside of
the surface.</p>

<p>Damage is double-buffered state, see wl_surface.commit.</p>

<p>The damage rectangle is specified in surface local coordinates.</p>

<p>The initial value for pending damage is empty: no damage.
wl_surface.damage adds pending damage: the new pending damage
is the union of old pending damage and the given rectangle.</p>

<p>wl_surface.commit assigns pending damage as the current damage,
and clears pending damage. The server will clear the current
damage as it repaints the surface.</p>

<div class='docblock'><p>request a frame throttling hint</p>

<p>Request a notification when it is a good time start drawing a new
frame, by creating a frame callback. This is useful for throttling
redrawing operations, and driving animations.</p>

<p>When a client is animating on a wl_surface, it can use the &#39;frame&#39;
request to get notified when it is a good time to draw and commit the
next frame of animation. If the client commits an update earlier than
that, it is likely that some updates will not make it to the display,
and the client is wasting resources by drawing too often.</p>

<p>The frame request will take effect on the next wl_surface.commit.
The notification will only be posted for one frame unless
requested again. For a wl_surface, the notifications are posted in
the order the frame requests were committed.</p>

<p>The server must send the notifications so that a client
will not send excessive updates, while still allowing
the highest possible update rate for clients that wait for the reply
before drawing again. The server should give some time for the client
to draw and commit after sending the frame callback events to let them
hit the next output refresh.</p>

<p>A server should avoid signalling the frame callbacks if the
surface is not visible in any way, e.g. the surface is off-screen,
or completely obscured by other opaque surfaces.</p>

<p>The object returned by this request will be destroyed by the
compositor after the callback is fired and as such the client must not
attempt to use it after that point.</p>

<p>The callback_data passed in the callback is the current time, in
milliseconds, with an undefined base.</p>

<div class='docblock'><p>set opaque region</p>

<p>This request sets the region of the surface that contains
opaque content.</p>

<p>The opaque region is an optimization hint for the compositor
that lets it optimize out redrawing of content behind opaque
regions.  Setting an opaque region is not required for correct
behaviour, but marking transparent content as opaque will result
in repaint artifacts.</p>

<p>The opaque region is specified in surface local coordinates.</p>

<p>The compositor ignores the parts of the opaque region that fall
outside of the surface.</p>

<p>Opaque region is double-buffered state, see wl_surface.commit.</p>

<p>wl_surface.set_opaque_region changes the pending opaque region.
wl_surface.commit copies the pending region to the current region.
Otherwise, the pending and current regions are never changed.</p>

<p>The initial value for opaque region is empty. Setting the pending
opaque region has copy semantics, and the wl_region object can be
destroyed immediately. A NULL wl_region causes the pending opaque
region to be set to empty.</p>
</div><h4 id='method.set_input_region' class='method'><code>fn <a href='#method.set_input_region' class='fnname'>set_input_region</a>(&amp;self, region: <a class='enum' href='https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/option/enum.Option.html' title='core::option::Option'>Option</a>&lt;&amp;<a class='struct' href='../../../wayland_client/wayland/compositor/struct.WlRegion.html' title='wayland_client::wayland::compositor::WlRegion'>WlRegion</a>&gt;)</code></h4>
<div class='docblock'><p>set input region</p>

<p>This request sets the region of the surface that can receive
pointer and touch events.</p>

<p>Input events happening outside of this region will try the next
surface in the server surface stack. The compositor ignores the
parts of the input region that fall outside of the surface.</p>

<p>The input region is specified in surface local coordinates.</p>

<p>Input region is double-buffered state, see wl_surface.commit.</p>

<p>wl_surface.set_input_region changes the pending input region.
wl_surface.commit copies the pending region to the current region.
Otherwise the pending and current regions are never changed,
except cursor and icon surfaces are special cases, see
wl_pointer.set_cursor and wl_data_device.start_drag.</p>

<p>The initial value for input region is infinite. That means the
whole surface will accept input. Setting the pending input region
has copy semantics, and the wl_region object can be destroyed
immediately. A NULL wl_region causes the input region to be set
to infinite.</p>
</div><h4 id='method.commit' class='method'><code>fn <a href='#method.commit' class='fnname'>commit</a>(&amp;self)</code></h4>
<div class='docblock'><p>commit pending surface state</p>

<p>Surface state (input, opaque, and damage regions, attached buffers,
etc.) is double-buffered. Protocol requests modify the pending
state, as opposed to current state in use by the compositor. Commit
request atomically applies all pending state, replacing the current
state. After commit, the new pending state is as documented for each
related request.</p>

<p>On commit, a pending wl_buffer is applied first, all other state
second. This means that all coordinates in double-buffered state are
relative to the new wl_buffer coming into use, except for
wl_surface.attach itself. If there is no pending wl_buffer, the
coordinates are relative to the current surface contents.</p>

<p>All requests that need a commit to become effective are documented
to affect double-buffered state.</p>

<p>Other interfaces may add further double-buffered surface state.</p>
</div><h4 id='method.set_buffer_transform' class='method'><code>fn <a href='#method.set_buffer_transform' class='fnname'>set_buffer_transform</a>(&amp;self, transform: <a class='primitive' href='https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.i32.html'>i32</a>)</code></h4>
<div class='docblock'><p>sets the buffer transformation</p>

<p>This request sets an optional transformation on how the compositor
interprets the contents of the buffer attached to the surface. The
accepted values for the transform parameter are the values for
wl_output.transform.</p>

<p>Buffer transform is double-buffered state, see wl_surface.commit.</p>

<p>A newly created surface has its buffer transformation set to normal.</p>

<p>wl_surface.set_buffer_transform changes the pending buffer
transformation. wl_surface.commit copies the pending buffer
transformation to the current one. Otherwise, the pending and current
values are never changed.</p>

<p>The purpose of this request is to allow clients to render content
according to the output transform, thus permiting the compositor to
use certain optimizations even if the display is rotated. Using
hardware overlays and scanning out a client buffer for fullscreen
surfaces are examples of such optimizations. Those optimizations are
highly dependent on the compositor implementation, so the use of this
request should be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>Note that if the transform value includes 90 or 270 degree rotation,
the width of the buffer will become the surface height and the height
of the buffer will become the surface width.</p>

<p>If transform is not one of the values from the
wl_output.transform enum the invalid_transform protocol error
is raised.</p>

<p>Requires interface version <code>&gt;= 2</code>.</p>
</div><h4 id='method.set_buffer_scale' class='method'><code>fn <a href='#method.set_buffer_scale' class='fnname'>set_buffer_scale</a>(&amp;self, scale: <a class='primitive' href='https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.i32.html'>i32</a>)</code></h4>
<div class='docblock'><p>sets the buffer scaling factor</p>

<p>This request sets an optional scaling factor on how the compositor
interprets the contents of the buffer attached to the window.</p>

<p>Buffer scale is double-buffered state, see wl_surface.commit.</p>

<p>A newly created surface has its buffer scale set to 1.</p>

<p>wl_surface.set_buffer_scale changes the pending buffer scale.
wl_surface.commit copies the pending buffer scale to the current one.
Otherwise, the pending and current values are never changed.</p>

<p>The purpose of this request is to allow clients to supply higher
resolution buffer data for use on high resolution outputs. Its
intended that you pick the same buffer scale as the scale of the
output that the surface is displayed on.This means the compositor
can avoid scaling when rendering the surface on that output.</p>

<p>Note that if the scale is larger than 1, then you have to attach
a buffer that is larger (by a factor of scale in each dimension)
than the desired surface size.</p>

<p>If scale is not positive the invalid_scale protocol error is
raised.</p>

<p>Requires interface version <code>&gt;= 3</code>.</p>

                <h2>Search Tricks</h2>

                <p>
                    Prefix searches with a type followed by a colon (e.g.
                    <code>fn:</code>) to restrict the search to a given type.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Accepted types are: <code>fn</code>, <code>mod</code>,
                    <code>struct</code>, <code>enum</code>,
                    <code>trait</code>, <code>type</code>, <code>macro</code>,
                    and <code>const</code>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Search functions by type signature (e.g.
                    <code>vec -> usize</code> or <code>* -> vec</code>)
                </p>
